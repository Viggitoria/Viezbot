# ViezBot

Viezbot is a quiz application aiming to resemble a chat. It's part of the Digital Viez Project by master students of Trier University in Germany.

It was developed as a web application using Ruby on Rails (https://rubyonrails.org/) to ensure its platform independency. 
The chat-bubble code (https://github.com/dmitrizzle/chat-bubble) was used as a basis and modified where necessary.


Before starting to code, make sure to create the DB with psql. 

The values can be initialized with the seeds.rb file via rails commandline.
In our case we put in values for questions, answers, booleans for correct 
or wrong answers, 
a key to map the respective answers to their corresponding questions as well as a table filled with fun facts.
